My name is Ana. This site is focused on p5.js sketches that
I've worked on in the past. Here are resources in case you're also interested
in learning to create them:

- [Processing](https://processing.org/) is the underlying system that started
it all.
- [p5.js framework](https://p5js.org/) is what I used to make the sketches play
on the page.
- [Daniel Shiffman's](https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman) youtube channel
has interesting challenges that you can get started with.


This is site is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/amnerip/processing-playground) and generated using [Hugo <3](https://gohugo.io/).
